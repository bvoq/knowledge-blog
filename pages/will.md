- The will acts as a **scrutiniser** on proposed intentional experiences until the valid intentional experience is found / appears. In other words it judges intentional experiences until it is happy with them. In fact it's more of a **nudger** that nudges you towards experiences that are closer to what you want. In addition, a dopamine kick should be released if they are found, otherwise no learning will happen. Reward network â‰  Attention network.
	- Examples
		- When I write this text I keep editing it over and over until my scrutiniser is happy with the result.
		- The baby keeps blabering random utterances until it can speak basic sentences.
		- You keep practicing wiggling one eyebrow in front of the mirror until you achieve it. It can help to first familiarise yourself with the experience of a valid eyebrow movement. When you manage to *move the brow* you can eat.
		- If you cannot wiggle one of your eyebrows, try to stand in front of a mirror and keep doing eyebrow movements until the lifting appears that you want. Be excited and conscious while doing so.
		- When learning how to validly build [[Toki Pona]] sentences you will scrutinise grammatically wrong sentences until you form a correct one.
		- When I try to go to McDonalds my mind will be occupied with remembering where I put the key to the car until I find it.
	- Motivation is dependent on this factor
- The scrutiniser is chosen using a [[reward function]] (loss function).
	- In reinforcement learning this reward is usually spread in such a way that it's sum is finite, meaning some $\gamma^t$ with $0 < \gamma < 1$ or alternatively $\frac{c}{t^2}$ for some $c$.
	- $$R = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t \qquad \text{ or } \qquad R = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{c}{t^2} r_t$$
- Formal theory of creativity, fun and intrinsic motivation.
- For focus just look up at something particular and stare at it (INTJ stare).
