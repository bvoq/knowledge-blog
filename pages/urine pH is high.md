- Urine pH provides information on acid-base balance. For the body to function properly it must maintain a normal blood pH (i.e. not be too acidic or too alkaline). The lungs and kidneys provide key functions to maintain pH balance, and urine pH reflects the action of the kidneys. Urine that is too acidic or alkaline can increase risk of developing kidney stones. Your urine pH is high, which indicates an alkaline urine environment. This can occur with urinary tract infection, consumption of large amounts of citrus fruits and a low-carbohydrate diet. Some medications can also affect urine pH. Repeat testing may be beneficial.
