- Antistreptolysin O (ASO) is an antibody produced by the immune system in response to infection with group A Streptococcus (strep) bacteria. Group A strep infections commonly affect the skin and throat and typically cause mild illness. Levels of ASO rise within 1-3 weeks of infection, reach a peak at around 3-5 weeks post-infection and fall to insignificance after a period of around 6-12 months. Your ASO level is high,signifying a current or recent strep infection.
