- Paradoxes:
	- Chronology protection conjecture
		- Time travel is only possible on microscopic scales.
	- Novikov self-consistency principle
		- Novikov self-consistency principle is the idea that if movement is possible backwards in time it is at least consistent. Everything that will have happened, happens when it happens once. This allow solutions without parallel timelines.
