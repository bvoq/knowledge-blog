- Truthhood of maps with respect to a [[territoryold]].
	- True maps
	- False maps
	- Unknown known maps
	- Known unknown maps
	- vs. False vs. Unknown Maps
	- Justified false maps
- Justified Maps
	- Observationally justified maps
		- [Molyneux's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molyneux%27s_problem) highlights the difference.
	- Derivably justified
		- Deductively justified maps:
			- Aristotle's syllogisms.
		- Inductively justified maps:
		- Abductively justified maps / Occams razor:
			- The kids that fought each other yesterday are now jogging together. Through abductive reasoning, I can derive that they made up with each other.
			- An unidentified head and an unidentified body where found 1km apart. Through abductive reasoning, I derive that they belong to the same person.
			- You see a picture of Churchill drawn in the sand. It could have been an ant that traced out Churchill but it is way more likely that some human drew it there.
			- Finding Neptune, instead of rejecting Newtonian physics, when encountering issues with Uranus' orbit.
			- Wrongly, Mercurys orbit was thought to be slightly of due to Vulcan, but it was due to General Relativity theory.
- Knowledge
	- Knowledge is commonly referred to as justified true beliefs.
	- Contextual knowledge is **knowledge that does not interven directly in the decision making process but constrains it**. All knowledge is contextual is the contextualists idea.
- [[Language]]-based maps
	- [[Language]] can be used to share maps and act as a transhumanistic replacement of memory.
	- Maps for teaching (Sequences)
	  id:: 62f2742f-8afe-4b59-adfe-2cb36352d603
		- Examples: Lectures, study books, guides, historical explanations
		- Share information in a given order such that later pages in a sequence reference earlier pages (topological order).
		- Historical explanations are an easy way to do this as knowledge has developed over time.
		- Purpose: Acquiring new information and learning tacit skills.
	- Maps as reference materials
		- Examples: Atlases, phonebooks, dictionaries, wikipedia,  standards, Programming language references, stad
		- Combination of both.
		- Purpose
			- Information storage
			- Facilitate information retrieval,
	- Maps for knowledge development (this one, logseq)
		- Examples: Logseq (this one), Obsidian, etc.
		- Purpose
			- knowledge development
				- knowledge development is the generation of useful connections that can be acted upon or provide new information that is relevant.
			- knowledge management

- Justified maps:
	- Observations vs. inferences. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2GxhAyn9aHqukap2S/looking-back-on-my-alignment-phd#Other_helpful_habits_I_picked_up_
	- "People often say they're afraid to die" is an *observation, *and (because of that) "people are hard-wired to be afraid of death" is an abductive *inference*.
-
- [[Language]] can be used to **share** maps.
- Useful beliefs
	- Limit ourselves to useful true beliefs.
	- Surprising & useless information to be avoided.
- **Information Surprisal and Utility**
	- Surprisal:
		- How much information is needed to express the state change of language transmitted map.
		- Kolmogorov surprisal
		- Shannon surprisal
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content
- knowledge development
	- knowledge development is the generation of useful connections that can be acted upon or provide new information that is relevant.
- knowledge management
	- 1. Information storage
	  2. Facilitate information retrieval
	  3. knowledge development is the generation of useful connections that can be acted upon or provide new information that is relevant.
	  4. Summarizing
	  5. Sorting -> Structuralist
	  5. Selecting / Sorting
	  Mental Hierarchies
	  Distributed Practice
- Knowledge is defined as "justified [true belief]([[Map vs. Territory]])".
- Observational facts (Empirical knowledge) vs. Derived facts (A-priori knowledge):
	- Derived facts:
	- [Molyneux's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molyneux%27s_problem) highlights the difference.
- Tacit vs. Explicit maps:
	- Tacit maps are things we can do but cannot explain. Tactile knowledge, like how to cycle a bike, how we can recognise a chair in an image, how we recognise the back button on a new smartphone application or emotional intelligence, etc.
	- Explicit maps are things we can share with others through language. Eg. There is a hamburger in the fridge.
	- Procedural knowledge tends to be a bit of both.
	  Eg. If you're hungry, you can find the keys to the car (explicit map) in order to drive (tacit knowledge) to McDonalds.

- Know how to teach a computer:
	- At this point you completely externalised knowledge.
- Know how to teach a
- Known unknown map / Mystery:
	- We know that there is something on the back of the moon, we just never seen it.
	- We know that a tool was made with a purpose but we don't know it.
- Unknown unknown maps: Maps of which we are not even aware that they exist.
	- Modern physics. The discovery that the speed of light is limited which lead to the discovery of general relativity.
	  These are unknown unknowns even if it follows naturally from the correct premises.
	- A lot of mathematics is unknown unknown at first. The discovery that the diagonal of the unit square is irrational.
