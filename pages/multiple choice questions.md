- Instead of checking: Is it possible, try also imagining whether it is impossible/not allowed.
- Have a strategy for 'possible answers' depending on the type of test and grading mechanism.
	- Write down pros/cons and make an educated guess.
- Sometimes the question is too unspecific. Try to extract some information from the possible answers.
