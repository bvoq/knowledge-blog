- Reduce the frequency and portions of chocolate, crisps, cakes, buns etc. that you consume. Aim to drink 6-8 glasses of fluids each day. Good sources of fluids include plain drinking water, tea or coffee (be aware of the amount of caffeine you are consuming) and fruit juices. Try to limit the amount of fizzy drinks in your diet, as they contain large amounts of sugar. In addition, excessive alcohol consumption can cause dehydration.
