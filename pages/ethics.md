- Is-ought problem / Humes guillotine
	- Humans have evolved to eat meat, therefore one ought to eat meat.
- Deontological ethics (e.g. Kantian ethics)
	- Morals/ethics are bound by action / duty, not the end result.
	- Problems:
		- Lying about hiding a jew might be the correct action.
		- What if the jew was secretly trying to escape without your knowledge and by lying about hiding a jew, the police catches him.
- Utilitarianism
	- One ought to optimise the greatest good for the greatest number.
	- Weighted utilitarianism
		- Assume there are 5 people on one sinking ship and one sinking ship with 1 person on it. You can only save the people from one sinking ship. Classic utilitarianism would always go for the 5 people, but this may be seen as unfair as the 1 person never got a chance to get saved. Weighted utilitarianism instead shifts the definition and throws a dice. If the dice lands on 6 (16.66% likelihood), the person from the sinking ship with only one person is saved, else the others are saved (83.33% likelihood).
- Virtue ethics (eg. Aristotelean ethics)
	- We should not discuss what you can't do (blacklist) but instead you should try to live a virtuous life (whitelist).
- Intuitionism / Non naturalism
	- Moral language cannot be reduced to a natural language, we just know what is right or wrong by intuition.
	- You don't need a law book about what is right/wrong.
	- Natural law (D tier)
		- Ethical rules are written in the world.
- Moral relativism
	- Moral are relative to the culture and period you live in.
	- Explains moral diversity, moral disagreements, moral changes, but also simplifies it to rituals.
	- How do we become more virtues?
- Quasi realism
	- We treat morality as though it is real, but ultimately it is not.
- Emotivism
	- Morality is just human emotion.
	- 'Murder is wrong' is not true/false, but they make you feel bad.
- Moral skepticism / Moral error theory / Moral nihilism
	- State that an action is never sure to be moral or not or even that ethics does not exist/make sense.
- Situation ethics:
	- Do the best you can for your fellow men in each situation (but what is it?)
