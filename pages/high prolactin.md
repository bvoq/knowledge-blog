- Your Female Hormonal Health results show high prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that promotes breast milk production during and post pregnancy. High levels outside of pregnancy or breast-feeding can occur with a prolactinoma, an often benign, prolactin-secreting growth of the pituitary gland. Additionally, prolactinlevels may be high with polycystic ovary syndrome and with hypothyroidism (anunderactive thyroid). A frequent cause of high prolactin is the presence ofmacroprolactin, an inactive form of prolactin that may be detected and cause a falselyhigh prolactin reading. Your results show no significant macroprolactin, indicating a-genuine rise in prolactin. Exercise, stress and some medications can also cause moderate increases in prolactin. Repeat testing and follow up with a doctor would beneficial.
