- The Sally-Anne False-Belief task is an experiment used to tell whether a child understands the difference between belief and reality. It goes as follows:
	- The child sees Sally hide a marble inside a covered basket, as Anne looks on.
	  Sally leaves the room, and Anne takes the marble out of the basket and hides it inside a lidded box.
	  Anne leaves the room, and Sally returns.
	  The experimenter asks the child where Sally will look for her marble.
	  Children under the age of four say that Sally will look for her marble inside the box. Children over the age of four say that Sally will look for her marble inside the basket.

- Human children over the age of (typically) four, first begin to understand what it means for Sally to lose her marbles - for Sally's beliefs to stop corresponding to reality. A three-year-old has a model only of *where the marble is*.  A four-year old is developing a theory of mind; they separately model *where the marble is* and *where Sally believes the marble is,* so they can notice when the two conflict - when Sally has a false belief.
