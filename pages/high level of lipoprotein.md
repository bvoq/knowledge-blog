- Lipoprotein (a) levels are genetically determined and raised levels are associated with increased risk of heart disease. However, unlike traditional risk factors for heart disease, changes to lifestyle or standard cholesterol-lowering medications do not affect lipoprotein (a) levels. Although changes to your lifestyle cannot modify lipoprotein (a), they can help to improve other heart disease risk factors, such as cholesterol and blood pressure, thereby lowering your risk of developing heart disease in the future.
